    <summary>The markdown-based note-taking app that doesn't suck.</summary>
    <description> Notable is a:
    * No proprietary formats: Notable is just a pretty front-end for a folder structured as shown above. Notes are plain Markdown files, their metadata is stored as Markdown front matter. Attachments are also plain files, if you attach a picture.jpg to a note everything about it will be preserved, and it will remain accessible like any other file.
    * Proper editor: Notable doesn't use any WYSIWYG editor, you just write some Markdown and it gets rendered as GitHub-flavored Markdown. The built-in editor is CodeMirror, this means you get things like multi-cursor by default. If you need more advanced editing features with a single shortcut you can open the current note in your default Markdown editor.
    * Indefinitely nestable tags: Pretty much all the other note-taking apps differentiate between notebooks, tags and templates. IMHO this unnecessarily complicates things. In Notable you can have root tags (foo), indefinitely nestable tags (foo/bar, foo/.../qux) and it still supports notebooks and templates, they are just special tags with a different icon (Notebooks/foo, Templates/foo/bar). </description>
